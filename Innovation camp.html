       <h1>Dropout Prevention Database</h1> 
    </div>
</div>


<div class="border2">
    <p>In 2012 Save The Children came in contact with the only teacher at one of their mobile schools in Babile. 
        The teacher shared the same reasons behind the number of children dropping out.</p>
    <p>Babile is a dry reion, which leads to a lot of the students not showing up at school, 
        and instead collect water and tries to take care of their families.</p>
    <p>In other instances, girls down to the age of 14 get married before completing their education. 
        Babile is a strip of land in Ethiopia, and in 2007 the country had a dropout rate of 60% in primary schools, 
        and many other African countries struggle with the same issues.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Save the children works towards helping children and securing their education.</p>
        <p>Every year the organization reports children who drop out from school all around the world</p>
        <p>They have most of the data, but they lack a way to reach the right and infuential people,
            who can help resolve this issue.</p>

</div>

<div class="border2">
    <p>Our group is focusing on African countries who
        who struggles with issues like these.</p>
    <p>We will introduce an IT-system, or a platform that will collect
        and process every piece of data collected so it reaches
        the right people.</p>
    <p>We will introduce a combination of an existing system, and our system,
        that will make it more efficient.

       <h3>The Humanitarian Data Exchange</h3> 
    </div>
</div>

<div> class="border2"
    <p>The Humanitarian Data Exchange is an open platform for sharing humanitarian data.</p>
    <p>We want to add geographical data to the attendance and enrollment
        in developing countries.</p>
    <p>Combining this new data set with other geographical humanitarian data shared
        on the HDX will enable Save the children to detect and understand underlying
        social and economic problems contributing to children dropping out.</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>An example of this would be to cross-reference data on food price and availability,
        with attendence data for students from a given region.</p>
    <p>This would make it possible to intervene earlier to ensure continued enrollment and attendence.</p>
    <p>The use of HDX-data will be faciliated by the HDX Python API,
        which makes it possible to both use and add data to the HDX-database.</p>

        <p>This project is a result of our very first week at school, where we had to
            come up with a solution for the drop out in the underdeveloped countries.</p>
        <p>We had many different ideas, and actually had a hard time deciding on one!</p>
