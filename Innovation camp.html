       <h1>Dropout Prevention Database</h1>

<div class="border2">
    <p>In 2012 Save The Children came in contact with the only teacher at one of their mobile schools in Babile. 
        The teacher shared the same reasons behind the number of children dropping out.</p>
    <p>Babile is a dry reion, which leads to a lot of the students not showing up at school, 
        and instead collect water and tries to take care of their families.</p>
    <p>In other instances, girls down to the age of 14 get married before completing their education. 
        Babile is a strip of land in Ethiopia, and in 2007 the country had a dropout rate of 60% in primary schools, 
        and many other African countries struggle with the same issues.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Save the children works towards helping children and securing their education.</p>
        <p>Every year the organization reports children who drop out from school all around the world</p>
        <p>They have most of the data, but they lack a way to reach the right and infuential people,
            who can help resolve this issue.</p>
